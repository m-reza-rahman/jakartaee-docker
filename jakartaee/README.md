# Basic Java EE CRUD Application
This is the basic Java EE 8 application used throughout the Docker and Kubernetes demos. It is a simple CRUD application. It uses Maven and Java EE 8 (JAX-RS, EJB, CDI, JPA, JSF, Bean Validation).

We use Eclipse but you can use any Maven capable IDE such as NetBeans. We use WebSphere Liberty but you should be able to use any Java EE 8 compatiple application server such as WildFly or Payara. We use Postgres but you can use any relational database such as MySQL.

## Setup

- Install JDK 8 (we used [AdoptOpenJDK OpenJDK 8 LTS/HotSpot](https://adoptopenjdk.net)).
- Install the Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers from [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/).
- Install Docker for your OS.
- Download this repository somewhere in your file system (easiest way might be to download as a zip and extract).

## Database Creation
The first step to getting the application running is getting the database up. The simplest way to actually do this is through Docker. Please follow the instructions below to get the database running.
* Make sure Docker is running. Open a console.
* Enter the following command and wait for the database to come up fully.
```
docker run -it --rm --name javaee-cafe-db -v pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data -p 5432:5432 postgres
```
* The database is now ready. To stop it, simply press Control-C.

## Running the Application
The next step is to get the application up and running. Follow the steps below to do so.
* Start Eclipse.
* Go to the 'Servers' panel, right click. Select New -> Server -> IBM -> WebSphere Application Server Liberty Server Adapter. Click Next. Accept the license agreement, click Finish.
* After the Eclipse WebSphere Liberty adapters are done installing, go to the 'Servers' panel again, right click. Select New -> Server -> IBM -> Liberty Server. Click Next. Select "Install from an archive or a repository". Click Next. Enter the destination path to install WebSphere Liberty. Select "Download and install a new runtime environment from ibm.com". Choose the "WAS Liberty with Java EE 8 Full Platform" option. Click next. Install the Java EE 8 Full Platform Bundle. Click Next. Accept the license agreement and click Next. Click Finish. When you are done, WebSphere Liberty will be set up in Eclipse.
* Find out where Eclipse has installed WebSphere Liberty in your file system. In the Servers panel, double click to open the WebSphere Liberty configuration. Click on Runtime Environment. Note the installation path.
* Browse to where you have this repository code in your file system. You will need to copy the server.xml and Postgres driver to the WebSphere install location. Both of these files are located under javaee/server. Copy the Postgres driver into the WebSphere Liberty installation location under usr/shared/resources. Now copy the server.xml into usr/servers/[your-server-name]/. The server name is probably defaultServer or newServer.
* Get the javaee-cafe application into the IDE. In order to do that, go to File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects. Then browse to where you have this repository code in your file system and select javaee/javaee-cafe. Accept the rest of the defaults and finish.
* Once the application loads, you should do a full Maven build by going to Right click the application -> Run As -> Maven install.
* It is now time to run the application. Go to Right click the application -> Run As -> Run on Server. Make sure to choose Liberty as the server going forward. Just accept the defaults and wait for the application to finish running.
* Once the application runs, Eclise will open it up in a browser. The application is available at [http://localhost:9080/javaee-cafe](http://localhost:9080/javaee-cafe).

## Content

The application is composed of:

- **A RESTFul service*:** protocol://hostname:port/javaee-cafe/rest/coffees

	- **_GET by Id_**: protocol://hostname:port/javaee-cafe/rest/coffees/{id} 
	- **_GET all_**: protocol://hostname:port/javaee-cafe/rest/coffees
	- **_POST_** to add a new element at: protocol://hostname:port/javaee-cafe/rest/coffees
	- **_DELETE_** to delete an element at: protocol://hostname:port/javaee-cafe/rest/coffees/{id}

- **A JSF Client:** protocol://hostname:port/javaee-cafe/index.xhtml

Feel free to take a minute to explore the application.
